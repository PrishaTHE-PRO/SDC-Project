/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * shared access for conversations, and public read access with owner-only writes for listings.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profiles. Each user can only read/write their own profile.
 * - /listings/{listingId}: Stores all item listings.  Listings are publicly readable, but only the owner can modify them.
 * - /conversations/{conversationId}: Stores metadata for message conversations between users.  Only participants can access.
 * - /conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores individual messages within a conversation. Access is restricted to conversation participants.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only list their own user documents. Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Listings are publicly readable but only editable by the seller.
 * - Conversations and messages are accessible only to the participants.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Listings denormalize the `sellerId` to simplify ownership checks.
 * - Conversations denormalize `participantIds` to efficiently control access.
